"I visited Mr Smith today and spent 2 hours at his home. When I arrived, his son greeted me at the door. I spoke to Mr Smith about football and he seemed well. I prepared some food for him and while he was eating I cleaned his bathroom and made his bed. He had a bit of a cough, which was slightly better than when I saw him last time. After watching TV for some time, we said goodbye. He was fine when I left him.",
"Mrs Goodwin was tired today. I got her out of bed but it was a struggle and she reported feeling weak. This happened last time, although not as bad. Iâ€™m a bit worried about her.",
James was very positive today. He told me lots of stories about him and his wife from when they were younger. He still has a fantastic memory - I was impressed! A wonderful gentleman and a pleasure to care for.,
